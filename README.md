              Revisit your Quadrilateral object hierarchy from yesterday. Add a way to:

                      * Calculate the perimeter of every shape.
                      * Calculate the area of shapes with right angles: rectangles and squares.
                      * Get the length of a single side of equilaterals: squares and rhombi.
                    
                   Use tests to confirm that all of your classes are working correctly.
